Thanks to the amazing [Github Community](https://github.com) I'm now able to provide an Alpine image of [mvhirsch/thumbor:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvhirsch/thumbor/tags)!
This image is even smaller, than _mvhirsch/thumbor:slim_ due to the fact, that Alpine is smaller and needs even less dependencies.

Please feel free, to use this image and don't forget to provide feedback and contribute: https://github.com/mvhirsch/thumbor-docker

You like this image? Please star it on [Github](https://github.com/mvhirsch/thumbor-docker) and [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvhirsch/thumbor).
