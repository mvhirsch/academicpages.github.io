... it's the exact right title. I found this jewel some time back, never got time to read it.
Finally the year's over, found some time aaaand I'm impressed.

You (as a software developer) should read it, too.

[What every programmer should know about memory](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf)

The document is a bit outdated, since it's from 2007 - but still worth a reading.
Technology did evolve since, but the principals are still the same.

If you find a more recent version, please tell me.


What to learn?
--------------

Basic understandings about static RAM and dynamic RAM (DRAM). How it evolved over time and how it works (especially on multi thread processors).

Practical tips on how to optimize memory usage for performance in C.
